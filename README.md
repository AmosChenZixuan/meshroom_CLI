# meshroom_CLI
Python script to control the phtogrammetry software Meshroom without its GUI


To run the code it is necesary to have Python 3 installed.
The program uses a dumy database of 6 pictures located in /dataset_monstree-master/mini6 .  Meshroom-2020.1.1 has to be in the same folder as the rest of the files of this repository.

Currently, the database and the location of the other folders (including the name of the meshroom folder) are hardcoded. It can be easily changed in the first few lines of the python file.

To run the program simply open Run.bat, which runs the python file.
The output folders and files are located in a new folder named Intermediate.
